# Python Best Practices: Writing Clean and Efficient Code

Python is known for its readability and simplicity, but writing clean and efficient code requires following some best practices. In this tutorial, we'll explore some key principles for writing better Python code.

## 1. Use List Comprehensions

Instead of:
```python
squares = []
for i in range(10):
    squares.append(i ** 2)
```

Prefer:
```python
squares = [i ** 2 for i in range(10)]
```

## 2. Context Managers with 'with'

Instead of:
```python
file = open('file.txt', 'r')
content = file.read()
file.close()
```

Prefer:
```python
with open('file.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()
```

## 3. Type Hints (Python 3.5+)

```python
def calculate_average(numbers: list[float]) -> float:
    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
```

## 4. Use f-strings (Python 3.6+)

Instead of:
```python
name = "Alice"
age = 25
print("My name is {} and I'm {} years old".format(name, age))
```

Prefer:
```python
print(f"My name is {name} and I'm {age} years old")
```

## Conclusion

Following these best practices will help you write more maintainable and efficient Python code. In future tutorials, we'll explore more advanced Python concepts and techniques.
